# Introduction

  AI is gradually becoming prevalent and profitable these years. It starts from a human-computer competition on March 2016, a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, beat the world champion Lee Sedol at the Game of Go. This game made a big splash and enlightened the prospect of AI-related industries.
  Investment strategy is essentially a kind of game of maximizing the benefit. Just like ‘the Game of Go’ mentioned above, computer does better than even the best human player. Therefore, utilizing AI algorithms in the investment strategy game, let computers make well-reckoned decisions rather than human effort, could not only save time and effort but also make more profit.

# Task Goal

  This course project is desired to train a Reinforcement Learning model which is able to automatically make optimized investment strategy on stocks and realize maximum profit. Gross target is to predict future trend of stock price movement and evaluate profitable buying and selling point. Firstly obtain, analyze and process previous stock data from yahoo finance API (raw data). Build a reinforcement learning framework and use cleaned data to train model. The excepted system will learn pervious datasets of some stocks, predict future stock trends and make investment strategy that can maximize the profit. Build a back-test system and test with practical trade scenarios with pre-trained model to do feedback assessment and back-train the model. Finally construct an UI and enable users to make trade simulations according to their preference.
